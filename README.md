## Projects Descriptions

## Question 1

It is a program that contains a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. This function iterates through each character in the input string and the program also contains a for loop. Once the for loop completes iterating through all the characters in the `inputString`, the function returns the `swappedString` which contains the string with the case of each character swapped.  If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and changes it to the `swappedString`. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and changes it to the `swappedString`. Finally, it returns the `swappedString`.

## Question 2

It is a program that contains a function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. The function takes two numbers, `start` and `end`, as parameters. It also initializes an empty array called `array`. Then it checks whether `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If it is, it iterates from `start` to `end` using a for loop and pushes each number to the `array`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it iterates from `start` to `end` in reverse order, pushing each number to the `array`. Finaaly, it returns the generated array.

## Question 3
It is a program that contains a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. Here we create a function that iterates through each number in the array and checks if its prime. 

`isPrime(number)`: This function checks whether a given number `number` is prime. It first handles special cases where `number` is less than or equal to 1, 2, or 3. Then, it checks divisibility by 2 and 3 to exclude even numbers and numbers divisible by 3. After that, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form 6k +/- 1 up to the square root of `number`.

`filterPrime(array)`: This function takes an array of numbers as input and uses the `isPrime` function to filter out only the prime numbers from the array using the `filter` method.

By using the `isPrime` function to efficiently identify prime numbers and then filtering them from the input array, the `filterPrime` function returns an array containing only the prime numbers in the same order they appear in the input array.
